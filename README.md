This is an imitation of Frogger that you can play!

You start out as the player at the bottom of the screen.

Using your arrow keys, navigate to the water, but do so
carefully, as you will have to start over if you hit the enemy bugs on your way.

You win the game when you hit the water!

At that point, you can hit refresh to play again ;)
